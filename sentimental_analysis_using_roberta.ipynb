bought this on amazon prime so i ended up buying the gb one for the camera is okay and i love the edit features you can do to the pictures amazon netflix huliu all run smoothly on this tablet the internet runs a lot faster than our other tablet too while over all i am happy with this tablet it did come with a couple disappointments that i wanted to make sure other people are aware of i am an amazon prime member and i thought that with amazon prime you could read a lot of books for free with a kindle and was disappointed to see you can only borrow one kindle book a month for free also one of the main reasons we purchased a tablet was because my kids love the plants vs zombies games the kids were quite disappointed that plants vs zombies is not available for the fire there are also other games apps that we were looking forward to using that are not available on the fire that were available for our previous cheaper neutab tablet that we were looking forward to using on this tablet i recommend people ask about apps they are looking forward to using before buying', 'all amazon products continue to meet my expectations', 'good product i like it', 'this kindle works well but the battery goes dead more quickly than you d expect really it is a version of the previous kindle that weighs less the internet browser works considerably better than the previous but still has

limited by amazon and purposely doesn t allow downloads of apps that aren t on amazon market place this tablet has soooo many problems as in slow connection to internet no connection to internet possible much of the time slow or no connection to videos games etc no support just reading other problems from other owners so do yourself a huge favor and buy anything else mine was a gift from my

kids i don t take advantage of all the things it can do but some things are confusing like how apps are loaded and then given to other profiles each app uses space and must be loaded to each profile so for me the same app is taking up space places for each profile and if you delete an app from the main profile it does not delete from the others and for the kids profile i can seem to get it removed at all it s not in the device screen but still shows in settings it s really confusing', 'does everything i wanted it to do', 'it works so well and fast not using it much yet until case comes in for fear of scratching fab display', 'good value but the operating system is a little buggy it periodically crashes and requires rebooting', 'i find that is not as easy to use as my regular kindle

up every time you turn the hd kindle fire on are annoying', 'returned prefer a more open android tablet as far as quality it is amazon and they never disappoint so if you are a strict amazonian this

'the sound is amazing the video is the best i don t bother watching the news on the television anymore i go straight to my kindle fire', 'this is the first real tablet i ve used with any success i was once given a prontotec tablet and it was so useless i was put off on tablets altogether but the kindle fire actually works and works well it s quick responds accurately to my touch and makes an excellent kindle ebook reader i ve been reading like crazy since i got it it also performs fine for simple things like checking email and getting notices from my gmail calendar for other uses like games or anything that involves text input i d rather be at my desktop with a big screen and good keyboard that s not a knock on the fire it s just my preference the point is that i haven t been downloading apps and using them other than sitting in my easy chair and reading i can t think of anything i d rather do on a tablet than on a desktop pc i once read that amazon sells the kindles at below cost in the hope the buyers will spend money on the books movies videos subscription services etc i don t know if that is true but really a tablet isn t of any value without the content so any review of the kindle fire must address that i have enjoyed my free trials of both amazon prime and kindle unlimited ku both are paid services that give you privileges and free stuff that you are paying for with your subscription i have decided to cancel both at the end of the free trial period next week i m not saying they aren t worth it i ve found a couple of good tv series on amazon prime bosch sneaky pete and read some good books from ku but after checking my reading wish list against the ku offerings i find that most of them are available on kindle for money but are not in the ku or prime catalog so i would still have to pay for them similarly the best movies on amazon video are not included in prime so despite paying for these free downloads and streams through the subscription i d still pay full retail on top of that i don t see the point of the subscriptionif that holds true i ve downloaded the overdrive app so i can get some of these ebooks from my local library i ll try that for awhile i ll also check out the free books that are always being offered on amazon and see how good or bad they are i may go back to ku after i ve compared that experience and i may just start buying kindle books without the subscriptions services i really like the kindle for book reading your needs and tastes may vary i just urge you to consider how you re going to use the kindle the fire does not allow access to the google app store downloads you have to get your apps from amazon s store many are free but you can t necessarily get the ones you would like that are available for android phones and tablets also this model is wi fi only so it s not connected using the cell service data plans that works for me because i don t take it out of the house but you may want to spring for something more expensive if you need to be always connected', 'love it', 'great', 'kindle is like a little computer that is lite to carry n your pocketbook n take with u everywhere the site comes n

generation kindle fire for three years before i sadly had to lay it to rest and the fault was entirely mine in all that time the only problem i ever had was with the charger which did not work unless i had it plugged in at a very specific angle i called tech support and they sent me a new charger free of charge just to make sure it was the charger and not the device the woman i spoke to was very helpful and it turned out the new charger worked fine so the original charger was defective not my kindle both my son and i loved playing games and reading books on the kindle fire and occasionally watching videos we downloaded we used it on a daily basis and i was very sad when i broke it i had taken it to an eye doctor appointment so i could read while i waited and that is where the accident happened as i rolled the chair over to the glaucoma testing machine my kindle flew out of my lap and slammed into the metal base of the machine i guess i was rolling a little too enthusiastically the device appeared to be fine the screen didn t even have a scratch on it but when i turned it on all i had was a half blue half black screen i haven t called tech support because it was a great excuse for me to get the new larger kindle fire i had been thinking about buying anyway i don t understand the negative reviews of this product at all if my kindle can slam into the metal base of a machine and not break the screen i have a hard time believing falling three feet on to grass or off the arm of the living room chair can break the screen i suspect the negative reviews are exaggerated by people upset at their own or their kid s clumsiness i highly recommend the kindle fire it is a great tablet for all of its many uses', 'i love kindle works great', 'this is a great little tablet that we bought for one of our kids as a parent i really like the kid s options that amazon provides amazon freetime and the parental controls i feel secure that they won t accidentally stumble on something

to purchase then bought there were problems trying to put it in my cart contacted amazon explained situation and they sold it to me at sales price great outfit', 'i m having concerns about the volumn it goes all the down to a faint whisper after a short time in use i m going to use it to watch something at length and see if this continues if so i will return it for a new one if this is necessary i will need a return label sent to me as i don t have a printer will be in touch', 'this kindle is so much better than the one i bought years ago it s so much faster advice get more gb i m having to

it this is the fourth one i bought one for myself and three others for gifts after two years i had a problem with mine i called amazon and they instructed me what to do and my problem was solved', 'i ve had my kindle month only use it s few times a week and it s already broken suddenly one day it no longer turned on i tried the power hold button for s to reset and doesn t work charged for hours doesn t work wish i would have read more of the negative reviews for to see that this device isn t very reliable still waiting to hear back from amazon to see if they will help fix the issue on my new

another one as the original did start gradually getting laggy i m afraid it doesn t hold the same quality poor battery life in comparison volume isn t as loud and i don t care for the placement of the buttons volume on off etc for the price it s ok but they ve gone down in quality and i don t expect it to last too bad my original requires frequent reboot doesn t compare to the ipad at all', 'i go tthis because my mother encouraged to get one she knows me well i ahve never been one not to love turning pages in of a book but i will try and get to love it like my mom', 'i would buy one wit more space gb is not enough even a two yr old for whom it was bought', 'very happy with the new tablet i had an original version and took advantage of the sale to order this', 'having lots of fun with this tablet colors are brilliant speakers are great overall couldn t be happier with it', 'it s a kindle it s an it s in hd what more is there to say the kindles are the best tablets for the money and rival tablets that cost much more i have complaints the white color is a nice touch', 'by far my most disappointing purchase on amazon ever i purchased this for my child and tried to set up the teen profile the teen profile is slightly if at all different from the toddler profile so if i want my child to actually use the device i have to set him her up as an adult thereby obtaining access to all of my content amazon should be ashamed of themselves for touting what could be a terrific product as kid friendly when freetime and parental controls are so obviously broken parents of children over look elsewhere', 'didn t like the picture quality of the cams very basic cam returned it within few days', 'it s exactly what i wanted i love the music books and videos so easy to use love it', 'i enjoy my kindle fire', 'finally retired my old kindal new is awesome', 'still learning to use it a bit more of a guide would be nice', 'the advertisements keeps making the shopping icon show up on my

much', 'excellent', 'i bought my kindle fire a couple of months ago i really like it i have had no problems so far my only complaint is i wish the sub or charging cord was longer because i have this thing that i like to read while my tablets charging', 'i read somewhere that the kindle ran on the android os so i bought it during the prime day sale they actually use a customized version of android os which they call fire and will not get you most of the cool apps that a regular android tablet will get you basically this was a waste of money for me and i am glad i paid the prime day price which was the most disappointing sale ever', 'this is my fourth kindle with the last three being kindle fires the first lasted years but then i accidentally cracked the display my granddaughter is now the proud owner of the second i find i like to have two kindles on hand so i never have to be tethered to a charger while i try to quickly and sometimes uncomfortably read the last chapter of a good book the phone app is okay in a reading emergency but i find it is not quite heavy enough to wake me up when it hits me in the face if i have fallen asleep while reading so my newest fire gets stars because finally the designers were thinking like actual kindle users by putting the power button at the top of the device instead of at the bottom where it was too easy to accidentally power cycle the charging port is at the top as well which is nice otherwise this device is pretty much the same as the last one good job amazon', 'it s a great little tablet i m very happy with it', 'is exactly what it says it would be', 'superb would be an understatement wish i had it years ago thanks a million', 'i have used this thing for about months now i got it as a late christmas present and i love the thing hoever i do have some nitpicks and they will be listed down below but as far as performance for less than an ipad or a surface this is a pretty great performance tablet probably thanks to amazon s lightwieght fireos as well as the quad core ghz for those who arent tech savvy a bigger number next to ghz is better means more speed arm processor powered by snapdragon i believe now the nitpicks when idling screen off charging etc it uses of the gb of ram that it has leaving you mb to fart around with bigger number next to gb is better as well no youtube google play services while some may like this and some may not i do wish for google play services but i also wish for amazon to keep it s current os look however you can run apks android apps on this device as long as you re willing to accept that amazon will not help you should an android apk causes internal system damage to your fire keyboard lag remember the mbs of ram that you are left to fart around with i forgot to factor in keyboard usage after keyboard usage mb and this causes some slow downs in terms of the keyboard and some other amazon apps and services and these are really the only complaints i have with the device on the scale of dream about it play with a store display unit or buy it i recommend buy it but to each his her own', 'replaced an older kindle fire enjoy using the new fire hd', 'battery life is exceptional lasted through my flight from iowa to oregon screen is bright even in sunlight', 'runs faster than my toshiba laptop thats for sure and the sound is alot louder and crisp i use it

efficient seems like it would be good for older kids as well', 'love it love it love it wanted one for years', 'it just arrived already charged i logged into my wifi then i set up my email my netflix my hulu my hbogo in minutes and i m a moderately low tech person no problems i watched a few shows to check it out and was amazed that there were no problems no weird wth is happening issues and the viewing on the is so clear and crisp great for taking on my vacation and to work so i don t miss my shows or emails will have to play with it more for the other aps so glad they added the payment plan so i didn t feel guilty about buying it for myself i wonder why they don t do the amazon prime as monthly payments like hulu and netflix i don t like the idea of repeating all at once big annual ach that i might forget is going to hit my account so i haven t gone for the prime even though i also have the firestick for my tv and love that too', 'so far so good my first tablet and i enjoy all the

is actually easier to use than the child interface', 'this is my econd kindel fire the first one was damaged by accident and i wanted to get the same thing as i was very happy with it', 'this is my nd kindle compared to my other kindle fire hd i believe is a version they are basically the same to use i have noticed that there are certain games only available on the newer version i like that my kids cant get on and play my stuff they can only access their profiles without my password they moved the charging port to a better location this new kindle battery life is only hrs until its drained of steady playing games and surfing the net graphics are better more clear', 'very cool table and easy to use the hd meets all my expectations battery life is not the greatest', 'good product my problem

kindle', 'exactly as expected', 'i m an apple lover this is the first kindle its hard to get used to i didn t like that i had to pay to get the constant ads off that was shocking i like the screen for reading i don t like that you can t personalize the screen saver', 'i m writing this review on my fire tablet right now it s a great little device i mainly for it for reading but i was pleasantly surprised by just how much it could do i really like how it came already plugged into my amazon account also i would recommend this to friends and family it d be great to buy electronic versions of

immensely easy to use and read', 'unfortunately the gb is not going to be enough gb s for the amount of tv film and other uses i will have for the tablet it is great for people who won t need to use

the one i returned to one of my children but they both have a tablet', 'i gave my old working fire hd to my hubby and he is so enjoying reading on it i love love my new kindle it works perfect and that cover with the key pad makes it even better great deal love amazon', 'i m really enjoying the fire hd th generation the tablet is nice looking and has an exceptionally vibrant screen i read comments about the os not being a real andriod but i ve been able to load or side load all of the apps i ve been using on my iphone the only app i haven t managed to install that had caused some issues has been google play a couple of the side loaded google apps say they need it but then the continue to function as normal i m not sure why amazon doesn t allow the loading of the google apps just to make the customer s life easier the tablet speed is quite adequate about of the time but on rare occasion things sort of stop then catch back up a couple of complaints i ve only been using the fire for roughly two weeks but it does not seem to have overwhelming battery life if i use it a lot i would probably charge it daily one of the reasons i was replacing my nook color was that i had to charge it every days that s not a completely fair comparison as i m doing much more on the fire but i had hoped the battery would last longer i ve installed utilities to give me some visibility into battery usage but there doesn t seem to be much i can do to help other than possibly turn off the wifi some but that s not why you buy a tablet is it second complaint is about accessories i guess there is confusion about the various versions that are in some way a kindle fire but not the hd th generation i had a hard time finding a case locally other than the odd one sold by amazon or generic cases with hooks on the side i ordered one from amazon com that was supposed to work but turns out even though it said it was for my machine it really wasn t i finally found a non prime seller that has a good reasonable priced case it just took a while and unlike anything starting with an i or a galaxy it is hard to find accessories locally and i live in a big town i purchasedit on prime day for and at that price the fire hd is an exceptional value would i feel the same had i paid i m not sure at full price i probably would have purchased the nook galaxy note tab primarily because it has an sd slot', 'the camera resolution is not very clear', 'very pleased i needed the update', 'i like it but it would be nice if it had a charge light like the fire so you know when it is done charging and didn t have to turn it on', 'i m only giving it a because the battery runs down pretty fast and i read a lot other than that i love having easy access to books that are not available in paper form from the library although i also miss touching library books other people have also read and enjoyed the low cost of ebooks is much appreciated it s nice to be able to adjust the light and the background shade also handy to have games like sudoku and the web at your fingertips', 'it is better than the original kindle the display is greatand the size is just perfect', 'easy to use and download books and apps', 'i never thought i would want or even like a kindle but so far as i m playing around with it to see all it can do i m loving it i was finally able to get a hold of books

terrible my granddaughter loves the games', 'just love my kindle meets all my needs yes i wish it had instagram or snap chat app but oh well', 'i enjoy my first kindle fire so much i ordered the

battery symbol very frustrated with this', 'i love this tablet well worth the money', 'love this but it s a little small', 'i got this during the amazon one day sale for the price it is a pretty good purchase after having it for a month it died i couldnt even factory reset and had to get a replacement amazon handled the replacement great and the new unit came in days as an e reader this works great however to be more of a tablet it left me desiring more i like that there is an extensive library of ebooks i like that i can search web if i want but i think i will go for a more robust tablet', 'excellent product meets my expectations', 'i love this tablet it is the perfect size', 'ok', 'i bought the fire hd on prime day for a good price my year old daughter uses it for her barbie dress up games and enjoys it i m not disappointed in my purchase for that reason as it was a cheap way to free up our ipad if i paid more i likely would feel different i still use it from time to time for shopping youtube etc i always end up putting it aside and getting the ipad as it just doesn t work as nicely in my opinion i keep giving it another chance but still prefer my ipad mini the battery life is the most disappointing it always needs charged it would lose the battery race by a long shot to our ipad mini', 'i am enjoying my new kindle so far i have read a couple of books i am still in the process of learning', 'this is my th kindle and my second fire my first was the simple one my second got left on a plane sob i preordered the kindle fire hd and it was worth the wait recently my

to take pictures with it it is the perfect size', 'like it', 'loved this tablet until i found out that you can t share downloaded prime instant videos on a child s profile the only way for the chd to watch prime videos is through the parent profile very inconvenient and not thrilled i m paying for prime and can t allow child to watch videos on long car rides update had to go down to two stars an update that came out a few months ago made it so that whenever you turn on the tablet it automatically boots to the parent profile before the update it would automatically load whichever profile was loaded when it shut down this change is causing a good deal of frustration with the toddler who used to be able to power it on and get into his profile with very little assistance also i purchased the full version of some preschool apps but they cannot be used in the child s profile because it does not allow for in app purchases while amazon was willing to refund my money for the apps their first response was to allow the child to use the apps in the parent s profile i felt that defeated the purpose of parental controls my husband and i use a samsung tablet when we upgrade our tablet we re going to give our old one to the kids because the samsung kid s mode app is more user friendly it allows in app purchases to be used in kid s mode and if the tablet shuts down in kid s mode it reboots in kid s mode', 'i m a bit disappointed the price was great but i ve had issues with the touch it doesn t recognize touch sometimes games freeze after playing them for a while and i was surprised to see that some games aren t compatible with the device', 'i was very disappointed in this device the device has one advertisement after another this was apparent even when checking my email the ads were so intrusive and they most likely contributed to the slow loading of pages i used this device once and knew this was a fail', 'loving my new kindle great graphics much better sound very easy ready to use', 'great kindle fire', 'still learning', 'it works well overall great for use as a kindle and for basic surfing if you re in need of a tablet for reading note taking and basic web surfing that isn t as large or expensive as an ipad this is a great alternative i ve had mine for a couple weeks now the processor is definitely a bit slower than an ipad but it still gets the job done the amazon store is missing some basic apps though which is a bit disappointing the wifi on my device also has some issues disconnecting often i m not experiencing this with any other devices so i know it s not the network however i d recommend to someone in the market for a cheaper ipad alternative', 'got it for bucks on cyber monday and i think it is great watching movies reading books on kindle side loading apps etc and though it only has gb of space i for one am not an app crazed young person so it fits my needs the battery is average but charges pretty fast it is the sponsored ads version but that is only on the locked screen so no biggie and i bought it for when i m at home so only needed the wifi version you just need to remember when you buy a mobile device is does it fit your needs because when you have a smartphone a home computer and a tablet then buying the most expensive top of the line product becomes redundant and unnecessary this is not saying that my fire hd is isn t good in fact it is great and it fits in with my needs buy it and i guarantee you ll be very pleased', 'can t wait till x mas i think my son will luv this', 'it gives me everything i could possibly

customer service was very helpful and they quickly sent me a replacement times this final replacement they sent me still has issues with going blank i ll just stick to my older kindle', 'the kindle itself works well and has many apps that you can use but amazon prime gives you horrible movies and music that you haven t even heard of before the wifi barely ever works in my experience even when it says that you re connected', 'i finally bought a kindle the tablet that i d been using would freeze regularly as tablets do and was particularly frustrating when i was reading a book when other apps froze i could switch to my phone but i didn t like reading on that small screen the kindle is perfect not only do i use it to read but i also put printer and docs apps on it it syncs with my calendar on other devices i d heard i d be busier after i d retired and it has proven to be true i really need that calendar with me all the time it s perfect for reading while i m on the treadmill at the gym

continue to use today i still had a technological hole in my heart wanting a smaller more portable tablet to read epub books and for light surfing facebook and pinterest i purchased the hd during the july sale and for a tablet i consider it a steel pros great picture intuitive set up performs well during regular use light surfing and streaming video provides me a smaller lighter tablet for reading epub books easy to switch between applications cons the battery life is just ok limited applications they still make it difficult to load android apps that aren t specifically marketed through amazon shopping on amazon using silk and the screen is not easy i usually revert back to my asus tablet or a pc it s a bit heavy to carry around in a purse in closure it is a great little device for the

happened again two kindle fires brand new out of the box neither worked i won t be trying a rd time', 'i was kinda leary about going to a new kindle but glad i made the change i really like it it is easier to use than the first generation kindle', 'my grandson was forever wanting my kindle he preferred it over his ds he just had his eighth birthday so i purchased this one for him he listens to music plays games and reads books he loves it and i enjoy not having to share mine', 'love kindle', 'love it', 'excellent product love the screen size and clear pictures easy to navigate and to many available apps to count', 'i was very excited at the purchase on the amazon anniversary but have been pretty disappointed with the battery life and system its good enough for what i paid but would probably not recommend it', 'so far appears to exceed my expectations stilllearning what it cando and what the limits are and still exploring it', 'low storage capacity poor camera feels like cheap plastic compared to my kindlefire the one good thing is that the keyboard is more usable was not worth the price', 'this is my first tablet it has exceeded my expectations it is easy to use and has many more functions than i thought it would other plusses are the size and weight both of which make it extremely portable', 'is the best so happy with it', 'i think it s ridiculous that you can t sign out of your e mail account i also would have liked to get the color i wanted without having all the ads', 'i ve had a nook for several years and have always been pleased with its performance but my new kindle fire out performs the nook i especially like the front and rear cameras and being able to record a video', 'it s a very good product easy learning curve a cheaper alternative to other tablets i approve', 'great purchase wonderful upgrade from my basic kindle couldn t be happier', 'all that i expected it to be', 'gb is too small get something bigger', 'very nice i really don t like all the ads and marketing is there a way to turn that off i d rate it higher if there wasn t ads polluting my screen every time i woke up my device', 'have to charge battery much more often not as user friendly as the kindle fire harder to figure out how to do certain functions', 'i bought the tablet to stream video to my tv i have a new tv with a chromecast i have been streaming with my phone but it is annoying when a call comes in to try to answer the phone and pause the streaming video by the time i have brought up the video and paused it the phone has stopped ringing and i have to call the person back i was streaming from amazon prime with no trouble with my phone but the tablet which i assumed would be easier if anything is not compatible with the chromecast i have tried for hours and cannot download a simple chromecast app to the tablet it does not recognize the chromecast on my tv so the tablet is useless for streaming i also have webroot software to provide security for my laptop desktop and phone and i cannot get it to recognize the fire tablet apparently amazon has gone to such extremes to be proprietary that it does not work with any other system or device i am very seriously considering sending it back i have worked to get the webroot and chromecast on the tablet for hours today and am to frustrated to continue i will probably try again before i return it', 'it only lasted about or months before the screen blacked out', 'excellent', 'i will never buy another amazon kindle fire etc product ever again not only was i transferred about different times to people no one could help me with my problem my kindle fire still won t work and the person who i last spoke with said amazon couldn t replace it meanwhile its amazons fault that my device is having the problem i usually always buy amazon products and now i m not so sure i will ever purchase from them again', 'love it', 'i have enjoyed it from the moment it carried', 'not impressed i have a kindle that is about five years old that is way better than this one i bought this because the battery in my original is starting to fade a lot sooner that it used to the battery on this one is worse than my older kindle i regret buying it', 'i had a regular kindle that i wore out i was afraid the fire hd wasn t going to be as good as advertised but it surpassed all my expectations i have recommended it to all my friends', 'love it', 'i really like it so far', 'while i purchased this tablet for a very attractive price and i think it does some functions very well i am disappointed by some aspects of the tablet first it does have advertising when you turn it on that itself is not a big deal but the fact that several android apps don t work on the device is a true impact on me in particular the lack of support for google chrome is a real deal breaker for me if you are looking for a device to consumer amazon content this tablet will do a nice job at a very attractive cost if you want a generalized android tablet you will disappointed and i think there are better alternative for less than more', 'i m glad i purchased this still learning what it can do', 'love it', 'antiglare protector screen does not work well the millions of free songs never seem to be the ones i want my taste runs to the classic rock s and s and there is a cost to almost every selection i made movies same story i will probably cancel amazon prime for the same reason if my experience doesn t change in the next few weeks otherwise the hardware is everything i expected', 'overall its a good tablet cons if you use google or one of its competitors it will slow and lagging', 'was so used to my previous kindle which allowed me to have all my unread books on the carousel and all read books in favorites loved this feature wish it was on this fire hd', 'requires additional e fee to remove ads from lock screen', 'fits perfect love the color not to heavy', 'its great', 'love it', 'both my husband and i love the kindle fire', 'the screen freezes often it does not always go to the last page you read sometimes it resets back to the beginning of the book', 'i already had a kindle but wanted another so that i would not have to wait for a charge in order to keep reading the second kindle has been the greatest thing no more waiting just switch to the second kindle and keep reading my only problem has been kicking myself for waiting so long get the second one', 'received the kindle fire hd yesterday easy to set up user friendly great screen quality but i do have several issues a amazon your app store is deplorable all the apps i really want i can only find on google play but google play doesn t work with kindle so you have to either sideload it or live without it amazon should really do something about that b i thought that i could mirror my screen to my tv only works with kindle hdx i like to watch tv shows from other countries in my browser and hoped i could fling on the big screen doesn t work kindle hd has a front and back facing camera but lousy quality i would consider a hdx but it only has a front facing camera is it that hard to put a front and rear facing camera on a device that costs almost not sure yet if i will keep it it s not much of an upgrade from my previous kindle hd', 'gets what i want done so no complaints here', 'for the price i purchased it during prime day and being my st tablet i think it was a great purchase just wish i had gotten a better case for it', 'very disappointed coming from a nook tablet i hate the ads on the lock screen it s not very customizable and the screen is ridiculous it s so shiny i mostly just see my own reflection not whats on the screen', 'i love my kindle fire hd so far no complaints', 'very good like a otter box for kendal', 'really like this', 'i ve had this tablet reader for about months i bought it to replace a nexus original gen that was getting on in years that was a mistake the fire hd while providing a nice screen is very frustrating to deal with when you re coming from a more versatile system to be clear the only things i really do on these devices is read books watch movies shows on channel specific or general apps like hulu netflix showtime etc occasionally browse the web and occasionally play games for these simple purposes the fire is okay but barely because it s a closed system you can only download apps from amazon who doesn t have the full complement of apps available on google play you can root the fire but that s way more work than should be necessary for something like this then there s the battery life which is horrible i now rarely use the fire because it always needs to be charged i can have it fully charged read something on it for minutes put it down for a day and come back to find it s out of juice my old nexus doesn t even eat battery like that that makes this thing an occasional device to use after my nexus runs down added to that despite its use of the universal micro usb it only seems to charge on its own cord which makes meet think it s poorly constructed to boot bottom line i regret wasting my money on this and will not be buying again or recommending to anyone else to purchase unless it s super cheap', 'i have read two novels on this device and i am very happy with it i have previously used the large kindle and ipad for reading but really do prefer the fire hd', 'the fire hd is great i will use this one for books other one for music so they are both great', 'this product is awesome with a very reasonable price its a pleasure to use as well as convenient i would recommend this product to anyone who loves to read', 'we had to take it back to best buy we have owned two others this one went bad within one week very disapointed', 'i don t like all the advertising for amazon', 'i would like to have more apps available the device was easy to use and the sound when playing music is great', 'my life has completely been changed and for the better this was a gift am i allowed to say that from a wonderful friend and a total surprise i am now able to take pictures videos i have downloaded a lot of my favorite music i have watched movies i ve read several books on it i check my email and face book all with this wonderful magical device i seriously don t know how i ever lived without it my favorite thing is that i have been able to download the bible onto it there is a handy way to look up scriptures sort of like a table of contents it takes me right to the chapter and verse i m looking for i can t rave enough about this consider this a smiley face', 'my wife is very happy with her fire', 'i gave this to my niece to have i had no idea it was pre loaded with my amazon information to be able to download and buy apps now i have to find away to get my personal info off the kindle', 'bought for my wife it was the only good deal they had on prime day she loves it now i can have my galaxy tab back', 'i saw the kindle fire and thought it was a bit to small so i ordered the screen to my surprise it was bigger than i expected i know it s only i was even more surprised of it s quality it was heavy and the picture quality was better than most tablets the speakers sound is extremely clear and very loud for its size overall for its size i m more than impressed with my new fire hd i love it', 'great product would give it a five if the battery lasted longer', 'love it except photos crashes all the time', 'love it perfect size and weight i dropped my year old kindle e reader and didn t want to replace it with another e reader so i picked this fire up during one of the promotions i use it mostly as an e reader but the kids use it for games learning apps and movies', 'i love this kindle i check my emails watch movies and play games', 'it s the best i bring it with me on my commutes to work and have grown quite addicted to it haven t used the camera yet but wow it has a camera i love my kindle', 'great buy still have a lot to learn', 'one of those products that reminds you of the saying you get what you pay for its not very responsive app store is limited and i get spammed by all sortsa unknown sources apps trying to download on my device sometimes i have had to restart the device coz its acting too slow on loading switching apps and i am only days into using this', 'quality and performance is very clear']\n"

            "This is the first real tablet I've used with any success. I was once given a ProntoTec 7&#34; tablet and it was so useless, I was put off on tablets altogether. But the Kindle Fire actually works, and works well. It's quick, responds accurately to my touch, and makes an excellent Kindle ebook reader. I've been reading like crazy since I got it. It also performs fine for simple things like checking email and getting notices from my gmail calendar. For other uses, like games, or anything that involves text input, I'd rather be at my desktop with a big screen and good keyboard. That's not a knock on the Fire, it's just my preference. The point is that I haven't been downloading apps and using them. Other than sitting in my easy chair and reading, I can't think of anything I'd rather do on a tablet than on a desktop PC.<br /><br />I once read that Amazon sells the Kindles at below cost in the hope the buyers will spend money on the books, movies, videos, subscription services, etc. I don't know if that is true, but really, a tablet isn't of any value without the content, so any review of the Kindle Fire must address that. I have enjoyed my free trials of both Amazon Prime and Kindle Unlimited (KU). Both are paid services that give you privileges and &#34;free&#34; stuff (that you are paying for with your subscription). I have decided to cancel both at the end of the free trial period next week. I'm not saying they aren't worth it. I've found a couple of good TV series on Amazon Prime (Bosch, Sneaky Pete) and read some good books from KU. But after checking my reading wish list against the KU offerings, I find that most of them are available on Kindle for money, but are not in the KU or Prime catalog. So I would still have to pay for them. Similarly, the best movies on Amazon video are not included in Prime. So despite paying for these free downloads and streams through the subscription, I'd still pay full retail on top of that. I don't see the point of the subscriptionif that holds true. I've downloaded the Overdrive app so I can get some of these ebooks from my local library. I'll try that for awhile. I'll also check out the free books that are always being offered on Amazon and see how good or bad they are. I may go back to KU after I've compared that experience. And I may just start buying Kindle books without the subscriptions services. I really like the Kindle for book reading.<br /><br />Your needs and tastes may vary. I just urge you to consider how you're going to use the Kindle. The Fire does not allow access to the Google app store downloads. You have to get your apps from Amazon's store. Many are free, but you can't necessarily get the ones you would like that are available for Android phones and tablets. Also, this model is wi-fi only, so it's not connected using the cell service data plans. That works for me because I don't take it out of the house, but you may want to spring for something more expensive if you need to be always connected.\n"
